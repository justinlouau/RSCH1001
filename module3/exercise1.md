#### Exercise 4: Flags and Arguments

**Flags**

Flags are additional arguments you can pass into calls to change the default behaviour and access more advanced functions.

Here are a few, try them out!

| Command 					| Description 				|
| ----------- 				| ----------- 				|
| `ls -a`					| Displays hidden files	 	|
| `rm -d <folder>`			| Removes a directory		|
| `rm -r <folder>`			| Removes files recursively (will remove all files in a folder including files in subfolders) - **CAUTION**		 |

You can also combine arguments - do not try this one out unless you are very sure

| Command 					| Description 				|
| ----------- 				| ----------- 				|
| `rm -rf <folder>`			| Removes files recursively and forcefully (without user confirmation) - <span style="color:red">**DANGER**</span>		 |
