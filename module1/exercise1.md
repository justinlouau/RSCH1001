#### Exercise 1: The Terminal

The terminal is the first tool every programmer should learn. With an interface that looks out of an 80s hacker movie, it is a stable and robust tool that has remained unchanged throughout the history of computing.

The terminal acts as an interface to your machine. It is much more powerful and efficient than the normal windows file explorer but it will feel very clunky at first!

1. First, install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) using this [guide](https://medium.com/markdown-monster-blog/getting-images-into-markdown-documents-and-weblog-posts-with-markdown-monster-9ec6f353d8ec)

2. Then install [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-au&gl=AU)

This will give you access to a Linux terminal, which is more powerful and than windows command prompt.
