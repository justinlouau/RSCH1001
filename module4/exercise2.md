#### Learning Regular Expressions (Regex)

#### Exercise 2: Hospital

There is a template file named sorting_enrolments_answers.txt which you must use to enter the answers for this exercise.

The file enrolments.psv contains a list of CSE enrolments.

The file enrolments.psv has 9 columns of data (columns are pipe separated):

    Admitting Department
    Patient ID
    Name
    Blood Pressure
    Condition(s)
    Health Rating
    Hospital
    Birthdate
    Sex

Each row of data represents one enrolment.
sdf
Write the sort and the head or tail commands needed to print the enrolment for the student with the lowest zID.

It should print:

    COMP9311|5200002|Chen, Jason Yi Kenny                              |8543|COMPA1|077.185|22T2|19971102|M

Note that this is one line.
The line is probably to long to display without wrapping in most browsers.

The same is true for the other parts of this activity.
For a better view, copy the expected output into a text editor.

Write the sort and the head or tail commands needed to print the first 100 enrolments ordered first by Course Code, then by zID. 

Write the sort and the head or tail commands needed to print the first 50 enrolments ordered first by Birthdate, then by Course Code, then by Zid. 

Write the sort and the head or tail commands needed to print the first 25 enrolments ordered first by the decimal part of the WAM in descending order, then by zID in ascending order, then by Course Code also in ascending order.
